## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r install-package, echo=FALSE}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("knitr")
#install.packages("bslib")
```

```{r}
#| my-chunk, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10,
#| fig.cap = "This is a long long
#|   long long caption."

plot(cars)
```

```{r, test-plot}
plot(1)         # high-level plot
abline(0, 1)    # low-level change
plot(rnorm(10)) # high-level plot
# many low-level changes in a loop (a single R expression)
for(i in 1:10) {
    abline(v = i, lty = 2)
}
```
```{r all_data,include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/master/full_data.csv"
all_data <- read_csv(url)
```

```{r youth}
library(dplyr)
youth <- filter(all_data, age<=65)
summary(youth)
```
```{r difference between original number of dataset and filtered set}
library(dplyr)
nrow(all_data) - nrow(youth)
```

```{r}
 youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(age))+
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth=1)
```

```{r race-dist,echo=FALSE}
youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race) %>% fct_rev()))+
  geom_bar()+ coord_flip() + labs(x="Victim race")
```
